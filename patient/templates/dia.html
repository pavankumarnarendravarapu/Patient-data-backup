	<h3>Diabetes Management</h3>
	<p>Diabetes is a manageable disease. With proper care and education, people with diabetes live healthy lives. Schedule an appointment to learn how to avoid the complications of this disease. We are continually expanding our services to meet this growing need in our community. Our Diabetes Support Group, ongoing for more than 20 years, meets at 2:30 p.m. on the second Monday of each month. The group is led by Dietitians and Diabetes Educators. Topics are generated by requests from the group. There is no charge for this program.<p>
